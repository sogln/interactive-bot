# Project Title

Building AI course project

## Summary

Interactive communication with an AI bot on a specific topic SCRUM


## Background

Anyone who wants to find information on a specific topic searches for the topic via search engines or wiki. But not everyone wants to inform themselves about a specific topic with long searches, but rather looks for an expert who can give them the answer to their questions. So it is obvious to use an AI bot for such tasks. This AI bot is limited to a concrete topic "SCRUM" and is supposed to show prototypically the possibilities for this kind of requirements.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:

## How is it used?

Any question on the topic of SCRUM is answered using the knowledge stored in the Neurostore. Currently the knowledge is limited to a SCRUM glossary. However, it can be supplemented by the SCRUM Foundation or wiki.

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

The data model is currently limited to the knowledge from a SCRUM glossary. As a result, the full information capability on SCRUM issues is not yet fully exploited.

## What next?

However, the project can be supplemented with other sources of knowledge on the subject of SCRUM. It also provides the basis for building up an all-encompassing knowledge database.
